Cart Lift has everything you need to set up and run a successful abandoned cart recovery campaign for your WooCommerce or Easy Digital download-based shopping cart.

You can create engaging abandoned cart email campaigns easily, to automatically reach customers who left shopping carts on your site.

Thus, winning them back to complete purchases and boosting your revenue. 💰

You can:

- 👍 Set strategic intervals between abandoned cart email campaigns to recover abandoned carts, resulting in better sales.*

- 👍 Use proven templates of **abandoned cart emails** with multiple follow-ups.

- 👍 Get exclusive reports on your abandoned cart email campaign and recover sales profit.


The plugin is aimed at helping you win back abandoned customers and increase revenue significantly. 💸

Plus you can get exclusive features that are easy to use and take only a few minutes to configure.

==⌛ Track Abandoned Cart Automatically (GDPR compatible) ⌛==

The plugin can automatically track the abandoned carts on your site.

Every time a person leaves your site with their shopping carts full, the plugin collects the data for that cart and initiates the recovery campaign on your set time intervals.

**📧 Set Up Your Abandoned Cart Recovery Campaign In A Few Clicks 📧**
You can set up your recovery campaign real quick. Simply decide on the Subject line and a compelling email copy, and activate the campaign. The plugin will do the rest.


==📩 Set Strategic Intervals To Send Emails 📩==
Set up multiple emails to be sent as a reminder for the cart abandonment. Set the amount of time after which each recovery email will be sent since the cart abandonment.

==📊 Get Detailed Cart Analytics On Revenue Recovered 📊==
The plugin gives you an accurate analytics board where you can know exactly,

- How many abandoned carts do you face,
- How much the abandoned carts were worth,
- How many carts were you successfully able to recover, and
- How much revenue you earned through the abandoned cart recovery emails

==📈 Easily Build Up Your Mailing List While Clients Shop 📈==
A special feature of the plugin is the Add To Cart Popup Modal.

When a guest visitor clicks on the Add To Cart button, a persuasive pop-up will appear and ask for the email address.

A great way to grow your mailing list and increase the abandoned cart recovery rate.

==🛑 Exit-Intent popup (Pro) 🛑==
Use this feature to prevent customers from abandoning the cart before they leave your site and recover the cart even before it gets abandoned


== Fully Compatible ==

The plugin is compatible with any theme and can handle any abandoned carts you face through WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What is an abandoned cart? =
When a buyer adds products to the cart, then leaves the site without completing the purchase, either from the cart page or from the checkout, it is considered as an abandoned cart.
= Can I run more than 2 email campaigns? =
In the Free plugin, you can only run 2 email campaigns at once.

For more campaigns, you have to use the Pro plugin.
= Does the plugin track abandoned carts? =
You can enable the option to track abandoned carts automatically.

Go to Dashboard > Cart Lift and click on the Settings tab.

There you will find an option to Enable Abandon Cart Tracking.

Once you enable it, the plugin will start keeping track and records of all abandoned carts on your store.
= Will it work if I don't use WooCommerce Or EDD? =
The plugin is specialized for WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads. So you have to be using one of the two to be able to use this plugin.
= Can I integrate it with other marketing automation tools? =
The plugin has the option to integrate with external marketing automation tools via webhook.
= How to add an unsubscribe link to the email?
When creating the email, you will find custom variables (on the right side of the text format panel).

From there, you can add the unsubscribe variable, which will work as the unsubscribe link for people to opt-out of the abandoned cart emails.
= Why aren't emails being sent out? =
First of all, make sure you have at least one email campaign activated.
Second, make sure you have WP Cron enabled for your site.

If these two are set, then your emails will be sent at the set intervals when you set up an abandoned cart email campaign.
=  How do I upgrade to pro? =
To upgrade to PRO, you may purchase a license key from:
Dashboard > Cart Lift > Go Pro
